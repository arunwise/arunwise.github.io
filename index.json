In PLP, inference is performed by summarizing the possible worlds which entail the query in a suitable data structure, and using this data structure to compute the answer probability. Systems such as ProbLog, PITA, etc., use propositional data structures like explanation graphs, BDDs, SDDs, etc., to represent the possible worlds. While this approach saves inference time due to substructure sharing, there are a number of problems where a more compact data structure is possible. We propose a data structure called Ordered Symbolic Derivation Diagram (OSDD) which captures the possible worlds by means of constraint formulas. We describe a program transformation technique to construct OSDDs via query evaluation, and give procedures to perform exact and approximate inference over OSDDs. Our approach has two key properties. Firstly, the exact inference procedure is a generalization of traditional inference, and results in speedup over the latter in certain settings. Secondly, the approximate technique is a generalization of likelihood weighting in Bayesian Networks, and allows us to perform sampling-based inference with lower rejection rate and variance. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques through experiments on several problems.","tags":null,"title":"Constraint-Based Inference in Probabilistic Logic Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arun Nampally","C.

Traditional inference in such languages involves the construction of an explanation graph for the query and computing probabilities over this graph. When evaluating queries over probabilistic logic programs with a large number of instances of random variables, traditional methods treat each instance separately. For many programs and queries, we observe that explanations can be summarized into substantially more compact structures, which we call lifted explanation graphs. In this paper, we define lifted explanation graphs and operations over them. In contrast to existing lifted inference techniques, our method for constructing lifted explanations naturally generalizes existing methods for constructing explanation graphs. To compute probability of query answers, we solve recurrences generated from the lifted graphs. We show examples where the use of our technique reduces the asymptotic complexity of inference.","tags":[],"title":"Inference in Probabilistic Logic Programs using Lifted Explanations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The inference problem, to determine the probability of query answers in PLP, is intractable in general, thereby motivating the need for approximate techniques. In this paper, we present a technique for approximate inference of conditional probabilities for PLP queries. It is an Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, where the distribution from which samples are drawn is modified as the Markov Chain is explored. In particular, the distribution is progressively modified to increase the likelihood that a generated sample is consistent with evidence. In our context, each sample is uniquely characterized by the outcomes of a set of random variables. Inspired by reinforcement learning, our technique propagates rewards to random variable/outcome pairs used in a sample based on whether the sample was consistent or not. The cumulative rewards of each outcome is used to derive a new ‚Äúadapted distribution‚Äù for each random variable. For a sequence of samples, the distributions are progressively adapted after each sample. For a query with ‚ÄúMarkovian evaluation structure‚Äù, we show that the adapted distribution of samples converges to the query‚Äôs conditional proba- bility distribution. For Markovian queries, we present a modified adaptation process that can be used in adaptive MCMC as well as adaptive independent sampling. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptive sampling methods for queries with and without Markovian evaluation structure.","tags":[],"title":"Adaptive MCMC-based inference in probabilistic logic programs","type":"publication"}]
