I am a computer scientist with a background in logic, probabilistic
inference/learning and artificial intelligence. Currently at Invitae,
I apply probabilistic machine learning models for challenging problems
in computational biology. Some of the projects that I have worked on
include developing a probabilistic model for variant interpretation
and developing an algorithm to leverage our sequence database together
with population genetics to impute missing data for targeted panels.

Beyond the application of ML to biology/genetics, I am interested ML
formalisms that leverage structured representations of domain
knowledge in the form of graphs and logical rules/theories --
statistical relational learning, probabilistic (logic) programming
etc. I have expertise in related tools such as <a
href="https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/problog/">ProbLog</a> and <a
href="https://pyro.ai">Pyro</a>.

<!-- To date, some of my most significant accomplishments include developing a state-of-the-art probabilistic model for variant interpretation, which has become a cornerstone of our product offering. I have also played a key role in developing an innovative algorithm that leverages our extensive sequence database and population genetics to impute missing data for targeted panels, significantly enhancing the accuracy and completeness of our genomic analyses. -->
